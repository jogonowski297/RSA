The RSA algorithm allows to create a pair of keys: a public key and a private key.
Everyone can receive the public key and use it to encrypt a message.
Only the owner of the private key would be able to decrypt that message.
Similarly, the owner of the private key can encrypt some data by using it, thus allowing everyone else to use the corresponding public key to decrypt the data.
RSA security is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers (this is so called the factoring problem).
